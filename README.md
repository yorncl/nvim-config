# nvim-config

This is my neovim configuration.

I was using [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim) for a long time. But I wanted something lighter than I can maintain myself easily.
This config is lua based. There's a couple of plugins for file navigation and features like LSP. All the plugins are managed by Packer.
